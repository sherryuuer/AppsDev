# the instruction from Angela for a backup.
# Instead of using twilio, I am going to use slack to test the error I met last week.
    ## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily
# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#TODO 1. - Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries. e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]
#TODO 2. - Get the day before yesterday's closing stock price
#TODO 3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20. Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp
#TODO 4. - Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before yesterday.
#TODO 5. - If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").
    ## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/ 
    # Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.
#TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation
    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.
#TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio. 
#Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
