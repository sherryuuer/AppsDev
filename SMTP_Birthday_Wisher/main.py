# To run and test the code you need to update 4 places:
# 1. Change MY_EMAIL/MY_PASSWORD to your own details.
# 2. Go to your email provider and make it allow less secure apps.
# 3. Update the SMTP ADDRESS to match your email provider.
# 4. Update birthdays.csv to contain today's month and day.
# See the solution video in the 100 Days of Python Course for explainations.
